Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: *Hmm…* Ye are known, but not well enough. What brings ye to my hall?  

- I seek work.  
	Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: There’s always work for those with strong arms and sharp wits. Prove yerself, and perhaps ye’ll earn more than just coin.  

- I bring news.  
	Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: *Speak then, and speak true.* A Jarl has no time for falsehoods.  

- How does one earn your favor?  
	Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: Strength, loyalty, and wisdom. A warrior with none is a dead man walkin’. Show me ye have them, and I may call ye ally.  

- Start again => start  
- End the conversation => END  

Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: If ye wish to stand among the strong, do not disappoint me.  

=> END
