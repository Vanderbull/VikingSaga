Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: [[Who stands before me?|What business have ye?|Speak quickly, I have matters to attend.]]  

Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: I rule these lands with iron and wisdom. If ye’ve come to waste me time, turn back now.  

- I seek work.  
	Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: Hah! A strong arm and a quick blade always find purpose here. There’s coin for those who know how to take it… and blood for those who don’t.  

- I bring news.  
	Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: *Hmm…* Speak then, and speak true. Lies in my hall are paid for in steel.  

- What must one do to earn your favor?  
	Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: Strength, loyalty, and a will that bends to no man. Prove yerself in battle, serve me well, and ye shall find a place in my hall.

Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: If ye wish to stand among the strong, do not disappoint me.
