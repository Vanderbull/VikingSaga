Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: *Hah!* I know of ye—nothing but trouble. Why should I not have ye thrown to the wolves?  

- I seek redemption.  
	Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: Redemption? *Hah!* Words are wind. If ye truly wish to change, prove it with blood and sweat. Perhaps there’s work suited for the likes of ye.  

- I am no enemy to you.  
	Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: That remains to be seen. Keep to yer own, and we’ll have no quarrel. But cross me again, and it’ll be the last thing ye do.  

- Start again => start  
- End the conversation => END  

Jarl Eirik Shadowfang: I’ll be watching ye, so mind yer steps.
