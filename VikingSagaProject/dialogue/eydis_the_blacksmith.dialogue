Eydis Ironhand: *Tch.* I've no time for wasters and thieves. If ye came to steal, turn around 'fore I break yer fingers.  

- I'm here to work, not steal.  
	Eydis Ironhand: Hah! Work, ye say? We'll see if ye can swing a hammer worth a damn.  

- Just looking around.  
	Eydis Ironhand: Then look fast and leave faster.  

- Start again => start  
- End the conversation => END  

Eydis Ironhand: Now, if ye ain't buyin', get out of my forge. Work waits for no one.  

=> END
