Arnvid the Skald: *Oh ho!* I’ve heard tales of ye… none of ‘em good. Why should I waste my voice on a scoundrel?  

- I’m not as bad as they say.  
	Arnvid the Skald: Words are cheap. Deeds, now those I remember.  

- Every villain has a tale worth telling.  
	Arnvid the Skald: *Hah!* Ye think so? Then tell me, what legend shall ye leave behind?
